# Finding-MSTs

This program uses Kruskal's and Prim's algorythms, in order to find the Minimum Spanning Tree of a graph.

- Uses diffrent algoryrthms to caluclate the result. Including: BFS, Floyd (Building Heap Data Structure from an array), Quick-Sort, Partition, and more.
- Displays the MST value using Kruskal's, then Prim's, then tries the remove one of the edges and try again with Kruskal's.
